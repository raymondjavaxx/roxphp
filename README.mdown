# RoxPHP

RoxPHP is a minimalist web application framework for PHP5 that allows you to quickly build web apps. The framework follows the [MVC architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and comes with an implementation of the [Active Record design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record) inspired by Ruby on Rails' [activerecord](http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord/).
